# The interaction between sex-specific selection and local adaptation in species without separate sexes


## Overview

This is a GitHub repository for the development of a collaborative research project begun at the 2017 ESEB Special Topics Network: *linking local adaptation with the evolution of sex-differences*. A major goal of the workshop was to put together a proposal for a Theme Issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B on sex-specific local adaptation. This project is intended to result in a contributed paper to this project. Here you can find all of the necessary code to reproduce the analyses and figures presented in the article. The *Mathematica* `.nb` files where the models are developed are not tracked by git, but can be downloaded as an online appendix (Appendix B) from the publisher website above (or contact me and I will be happy to provide if you don't have access to the appendices). Aside from the `.nb` files, all necessary code for creating the figures can be found in the `./R/functions-*.R` files. 


## Abstract 

Local adaptation in hermaphrodite species can be based on a variety of fit- ness components, including survival, as well as both female and male sex- functions within individuals. When selection via female and male fitness components varies spatially (e.g. due to environmental heterogeneity), local adaptation will depend, in part, on variation in selection through each fitness component, and the extent to which genetic trade-offs between sex-functions maintain genetic variation necessary for adaptation. Local adaptation will also depend on the hermaphrodite mating system because self-fertilization alters several key factors influencing selection and the maintenance of genetic variance underlying trade-offs between the sex-functions (sexually antagonistic polymorphism). As a first step to guide intuition regarding sex-specific adaptation in hermaphrodites, we develop a simple theoretical model incorporating the essential features of hermaphrodite mating and adaptation in a spatially heterogeneous environment, and explore the interaction between sex-specific selection, self-fertilization and local adaptation. Our results suggest that opportu- nities for sex-specific local adaptation in hermaphrodites depend strongly on the extent of self-fertilization and inbreeding depression. Using our model as a conceptual framework, we provide a broad overview of the lit- erature on sex-specific selection and local adaptation in hermaphroditic plants and animals, emphasizing promising future directions in light of our theoretical predictions.

This article is part of the theme issue ‘Linking local adaptation with the evolution of sex differences’.
